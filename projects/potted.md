An ecommerce plant shop that features an array of products, each with its own details page, an editable shopping cart, a favorites page with items that are favorited, payment processing handled by Stripe, and Google or email account creation and login.

Redux and memoization are used for efficient state management of user authentication, shop products, favorited items and shopping cart, and redux-saga is used in the handling of asynchronous actions.
